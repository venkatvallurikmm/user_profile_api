Curl request without token header.

```
curl -i "http://127.0.0.1:5000/users/{organization}/profile"
```

Note: In case we need to access more than 60 requests per hour, then only Token should be provided, otherwise there is no need to
provide any token in the header

- [Generate your own Token ](https://github.com/settings/tokens)

 
Curl request with token header.
```
curl -i -H "x-github-auth-token: {token}" "http://127.0.0.1:5000/users/{organization}/profile"
```
